        <p>Hello there! <br><br> My name is Josh. I am a Technical Artist and Programmer. I make rigs, tools, design levels, and have a broad understanding of most aspects of the 3D content creation pipeline, so that means I generally do anything that's necessary to make sure development goes smoothly. I love to take on complex challenges and reduce them to small, easily understandable chunks, applying this methodology to create rigs and tools that are easy to use, and provide a high quality user experience.</p>
        
        <p>I was drawn to tech art because I enjoy taking on tough challenges and coming up with solutions that add value to the lives of the people around me. I consider myself a lifelong learner, and I'm always working on picking up new skills, because I believe in doing everything to the best of my ability, and that such an attitude enriches my life and increases my ability to both communicate and add practical value to the teams I work with. Here are a few examples of my past endeavors:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>I play more than 10 musical instruments and have formal training and performing experience in concert and marching percussion, classical and jazz piano, and guitar.</li>
            <li>I love to cook from scratch, bake my own bread, make sauerkraut and kombucha, and grow my own produce in the garden.</li>
            <li>I do my own car maintenance and have repaired brake lines, timing belts, water pumps, spark plugs, suspension parts, and A/C components.</li>
            <li>I taught myself how to solder and repair headphones, car components, replace SNES cartridge batteries, and more.</li>
            <li>I built this website from scratch, rather than using a service like wordpress or wix.</li>
        </ul>
        
        <p>For me, it's really all about exploring new possibilities and stretching my limits because at the end of the day, it allows me to make a bigger impact. There's no better feeling than giving away a fresh baked loaf of bread or being the person who can help a stranded family get their car back on the road, and this is what drives me to keep pushing forward.</p>
        
        <p>Now that's probably quite enough about me, but if you have any questions or want to get in touch check out my
